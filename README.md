Simple Neural Network (No ML Libraries)

University project for the Artificial Intelligence course.
The goal was to build a basic 2–2–2 neural network from scratch,
using only numpy and the notation from lecture formulas.

The network performs binary classification (male/female) based on height and weight,
trained with sigmoid activation, MSE loss, and backpropagation.

All computations and weight updates are implemented manually.
